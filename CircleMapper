def mapper():

    '''
    Function: 
        mapper

    Purpose: 
        maps a set of coordinates onto an array, taking average value of pixels selected
        Finds difference between two circles to produce a "Gradient"
        Currently uses the circlegenerator function but this could be changed in future to allow more diverse mapping

    Inputs: 
        Image in FITS format (Not able to be specified outside of the code for the time being)
        radius (Currently set by user input)

    Outputs: 
        ColourGradient (float): takes difference of the inner and outer circles to produce a gradient
                                - more negative value indicates a gradient towards blue at the outer edge
                                - more positive value indicates a gradient towards red at the outer edge
                                - greater the absolute value, the bigger the difference in colour

    NB FOR THE FUTURE:

    More reliable results can be gained by taking average colour at more radii, 
    potential for a loop to be used to run through all possible interger radii within bounds of the source

    Data my be difficult to quantify, but could be used for one or two galaxies to examine interesting galaxies such as 
    those with a large extent and a blue strip somewhere along the glactic disk, or for use on galaxies where there is a
    gradient towards blue toward the outer area of the galaxy
